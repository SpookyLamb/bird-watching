          <h2>THEY'RE WATCHING</h2>
          <section>
            <p>When you look up into the sky, do you see "birds"? We're told that they're animals, "descendants" of DINOSAURS no less, but don't be fooled. Every "bird" you see in the sky? It's actually a drone operated by the United States Government to spy on red-blooded American patriots like you and me. 
              Whether you have just taken the red pill and now see the truth, or you already know just how deep this conspiracy has penetrated our republic, you can share sightings, evidence, tips, and photos with other like-minded people on our <a href="#">forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Don't waste any time! Now that you know, they WILL be coming for you. Grab what you need, then turn off that computer and GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!</p>
